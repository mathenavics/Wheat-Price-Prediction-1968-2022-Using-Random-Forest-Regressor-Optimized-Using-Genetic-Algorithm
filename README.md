# Wheat-Price-Prediction-1968-2022-Using-Random-Forest-Regressor-Optimized-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
this project consists of a newer approach to price prediction where we use genetic algorithm to optimize random forest regressor to predict price of commodity (wheat) which uses a non- linear approach as compared to traditional methods such as ARIMA.
## Introduction
<p align="justify"> Agriculture plays a critical role in ensuring food security, economic stability, and rural livelihood development. In India, wheat represents a key crop whose pricing directly affects national food supply chains and market stability. Traditional price forecasting approaches often fail to capture the nonlinear and multi-dimensional relationships among environmental, production, and market variables. To address this gap, this research proposes a hybrid machine learning model that integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a Random Forest Regressor (RFR) for the optimization of hyperparameters, thereby improving prediction accuracy. The goal is to provide the government, farmers, and agribusinesses with a reliable forecasting tool that supports informed decision-making under uncertainty.
