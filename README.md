# Wheat-Price-Prediction-1968-2022-Using-Random-Forest-Regressor-Optimized-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
this project consists of a newer approach to price prediction where we use genetic algorithm to optimize random forest regressor to predict price of commodity (wheat) which uses a non- linear approach as compared to traditional methods such as ARIMA.
